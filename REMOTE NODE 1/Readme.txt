ðŸ“š Libraries Required
Ensure the following libraries are installed in your Arduino IDE:

RF24 by TMRh20: For communication with the nRF24L01 module.
SPI: Used by the RF24 library.
Install via Library Manager or manually from the Arduino Library GitHub.

ðŸ§ª Testing & Debugging
Use Serial Monitor to print sensor readings before transmitting.

Ensure no wiring issues; nRF24L01 is sensitive to power supply fluctuations.
Keep the module away from power-consuming devices to reduce interference.
